## Machine Learning Project Using Python

Imagine we have online **Music store**. When our users sign up we ask their age and gender and based on their profile we recommend various music albums they are likely to buy.

So in this project we use machine learning to increase our sales.

So we are going to build a model. We feed this model with some sample data based on the existing users. Our model will learn the patterns in our data so we can ask it to make predictions.
When a user signs up we tell our model hey, we have a new user with this profile. What kind of music this user is interested in?.
Our model will say jazz or hiphop or whatever and based on that we can make suggestions to the user .
So this is he problem we are going to solve.

Steps to follow:

1. Import the data.
2. Clean the data.
3. Split the data into training/ Test sets.
4. Create a model.
5. Train the model.
6. Evaluate and Improve.
